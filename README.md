# Restaurant-Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Insights
This project focuses on analyzing restaurant sales data and building a machine learning model to predict the total order value. The dataset consists of historical restaurant transactions containing both categorical and numerical features. The data was cleaned, preprocessed, and explored using visual analytics to identify patterns and relationships. A Linear Regression model was trained on the processed data to predict order totals. The model performance was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score. Finally, the trained model was deployed using Gradio to provide an interactive web-based prediction interface.
